# FrameData
This program helps a user create a fighter for a game, and allows the user to input information on that fighter such as the name, moves, and tips for how to use, and how to play against the fighter.

The program is using 4 class and 1 package, it uses an array to store the information on the fighter, and uses a GUI to help the user navigate the creator.

After the user has created the fighter, the user will be able to pull a list of the fighters that have been created and will be able to either remove a fighter if desired, or add more fighters as well. The program will exit on close of the application, or exit if the user enters the cancel button from the main menu.

This program is the starting blocks to help a user create fighters quickly and efficiently, and could be used for games like Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter, or really any games that use a fighter as the main character.
